USAGE:
1) Import package to your unity project
2) Drag one of the ghost or banshee prefabs into your viewport window
3) Characters come with Animation controller which animates its Idle Animation as a default state
4) You can use your scripts or game logic to animate the character
5) For setting up your animations keep in mind:

* IDLE states are meant to be characters default state before noticing the player

* You can animate attacks, gethit animation, defend, die animation etc... 

  IDLE is meant to be a default state from which your character will go into other   animations and come back to. 

* DIE animations automatically transition into DEAD animation 

* locomotion and idle animations are looped

If you would like to make your own animations, use included character rig
and export FBX into your unity project
